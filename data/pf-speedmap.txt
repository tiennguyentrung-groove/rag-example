Punt Punt might have created the most advanced speed map in global horse racing.

They dynamically update and show if a horse is advantaged or disadvantaged, based on the historical run style and barrier of each runner.

Hard to read in the image below but highly functional and user-friendly on the website. The colour shades immediately tell you who is favoured (based on their historical runstyle, the barrier, rail position and the venue).

All that condensed into a colour and number in a second.
